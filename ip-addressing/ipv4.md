# IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4)

## What is IPv4?
IPv4 is a system used to identify devices on a network using numerical addresses.

## Format
IPv4 uses 32 bits and is written as four decimal numbers:
Example:
192.168.1.10

Each number ranges from 0 to 255.

## Private IPv4 Addresses
Used inside local networks:
 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255
 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255
 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255

## Public IPv4
Public IPv4 addresses are assigned by ISPs and used on the internet.

## Limitation
IPv4 has a limited number of addresses, which led to the creation of IPv6.
